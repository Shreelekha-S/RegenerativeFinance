#### Housing Model Analysis - Machine Learning Model
---
Trains Models to to identify, categorize and value Housing Sales Price per sqft and Price. 
    
* **Data Highlights - AMES, IOWA Assessor's Home Sales(2006 - 2010)**
      
     * 2930 Rows * 82 columns (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous variables)
     * Nominal Variables : Identifies the type of dwelling involved in the sale and zoning classification
     * Ordinal: General shape of property and type of utilities
     * Discrete: Original construction dates
     * Continuous: Masonry veneer area in square feet

* **Cluster Analysis (K = Number of Clusters in the dataset = 7)**
      
     * Sale Price by Price / Sqft by Cluster
